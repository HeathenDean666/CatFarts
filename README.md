# CATFARTS

This is CatFarts. It is a work in progress. We hope it's fun.


# Instructions
Until available for download- pull the code, run it using Android Studio, and debug on your Android device.

Should be available for download in the PlayStore and F-Droid soon.

Hopefully pretty self-explanatory once it's installed.
'Start' is the main function of the game.
'Settings' has game and system options, upload functionality (when available), and some goodies.
